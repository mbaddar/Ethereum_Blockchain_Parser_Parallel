This part aims to extract transactions related data from the blockchain. 
Open Studio 3T and connect to your local db that has the blocks.

Inside the Analysis folder there are '.js' saved aggregate functions. 
Open and run those aggregate pipelines in Studio 3T according to the steps.
After execution, refresh your collections folder to see the new collections made.


Things to do:
1. Verify extracted data.
2. Export relevant fields for plotting.
3. Plot the graphs.
4. Explain the graphs.

The python code is not to be run in its current state. If I get a chance to fix it I will update.
